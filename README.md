# Practical Work II

## Design Detailed Document (DDD)


### Software Development Process:


- Planning and Structure:

I created a sitemap following the guide for the project that included all the pages necessary for the development of the website. 

In this sitemap I included pages such as the home page (index), an about me section, topic research, my degree explanation, my network and peer websites and a contact form.



- HTML Framework:

I created an HTML Framework for each page that included a consistent layout with a navigation bar, header, main, section and footer.



- Styling with CSS:

I created a styles.css file that all the HTML pages shared in order to ensure a consistent design across all of the pages.

I gave all the pages styles taking into consideration aesthetics and readability with the use of elements such as paddings, margins and colors.



- Adding Content:

I filled each page with relevant content, including text, images, and forms. Always taking into consideration the project guide to make sure that each page's content followed all the requirements.

I also incorporated links (both external and between pages) and lists for organization and easy navigation between the pages to make sure I was developing a fully functioning software.



- Deployment: 

Finally, I uploaded all files (HTML, CSS, and assets) to GitHub Pages in order to make sure that all of the pages and their content were fully functional.




### Problems and issues occurred during development:


- Layout Misalignment:

**Issue:** The content and elements were not properly aligned. Sections overlapped, and text appeared outside the designated areas.


**Solution:** Added properties like justify-content and align-items to center content and ensure spacing.



- Broken Navigation Links: 

**Issue:** Some navigation links didn't work because of incorrect file paths or filenames. Clicking on the links resulted in a "404 Page Not Found" error.


**Solution:** Double-checked all file names and ensured they matched exactly. Verified relative paths and tested each link manually. Added a consistent folder structure to avoid confusion when linking files.



- Inconsistent Styling Across Pages: 

**Issue:** Different pages displayed inconsistent colors, fonts, and spacing, making the design look unprofessional.


**Solution:** Created a single external CSS file and linked it to all HTML pages to maintain uniform styling. Used CSS variables for colors and fonts to make changes easier. 



- Image Display Issues: 

**Issue:** Some images did not load properly, showing broken image icons or appearing stretched and pixelated.


**Solution:** Checked and corrected file paths to ensure they matched the image filenames and locations. Added CSS properties like max-width: 100% and height: auto to make images responsive.




### Conclusions:


Working on this website has been a rewarding and educational experience. It allowed me to apply my knowledge of HTML and CSS in a practical way, turning ideas into a functional and visually appealing project.


I faced several challenges during the development process, but overcoming them helped me grow both technically and personally. I learned to stay patient, pay attention to details, and troubleshoot problems effectively.


This project has given me more confidence in web development and has motivated me to continue improving my skills. I'm proud of the final result and excited to take on more projects in the future!
